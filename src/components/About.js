            <h3>Design</h3>
            <p>
              I have a stubborn attitude. The only thing I believe in is my power of observations. I try to collect
              visual cues, cognitive data wherever I go, whether its an airport or a bathroom. It helps me to stay sharp
              and improves my design thinking capabilities.
            </p>
            <p>
              Apart from this, I try to stay upto date with the latest design and technology trends. I always try to
              find problems in the environment and ways of solving them through design. Even a tiniest bit of
              behavioural change in people sparks a joyous and adventourous feeling in me which allows me to become more
              motivated.

              I played a range of games starting from mario to pubg (currently). I was a good counter strike 1.6 player
              and had an DOTA MMR of 3200 in 2013. Right now, I play PUBG and in each season I go upto a rank of
              3000-7000 in ASIA squad TPP.

              As a designer and a thinker we need to observe and perceive data from environment. Gaming increases
              vision, and improves decision making skills. Imagine the decision making you have to do with{' '}
