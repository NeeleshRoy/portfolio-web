            I was a part of a team called digital experimentation and customer experience optimization. I used a tool
            called optimizely to set up A/B and A/B/N tests throughout DOTCOM. At First, I used to set up the
            experiments, collect the metrics data and share it to the stakeholders. Later on, I dived into developing
            hypothesis for the experimentation program.
          </p>
          <p>
            We used a tool called optimizely to set up all the experiments. Optimizely is also integrated with Adobe
            analytics (Custom) to take care of all the primary metrics.
          </p>
          <p>
            My experiments and implementations has led to 27% recipe wins in Large view and 24% recipe wins in small
            view web in the FY-2019. I have delivered 80+ experiments till now.

            Some of the experiments are mentioned below alongwith the target, results and hypothesis. Please understand

      <h3>Homepage experiments</h3>
      <section>
        <div className='experiment-card'>
          <h5>Last item viewed toast message</h5>
          <p>
            Hypothesis: By drawing the customer attention to the last item they viewed and Shopping History to see all
            their Recently Viewed items, we deliver a friction-free experience that will result in higher conversion.
          </p>
          <p>Target: Entire site except cart and after, in the funnel</p>
          <p>
            Recipes:
            <ul>
              <li>Control: Does not have a toast message</li>
              <li>Recipe B: Toast message with only text</li>
              <li>Recipe C: Toast message with text and product images</li>
            </ul>
          </p>

          <p>
            Result: Increase in shopping history engagement and the uber menu engagement. But, none of them actually
            lifted the purchase conversion, or RPV etc. So, either of them could be implemented.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div className='experiment-card'>
          <h5>Small view web - primary carousel presentation</h5>
          <p>
            Hypothesis: By enhancing the small view presentation of the primary message we can increase engagement and
            overall performance.
          </p>
          <p>Target: Web small view, homepage only</p>
          <p>
            Recipes:
            <ul>
              <li>Control: Existing carousel</li>
              <li>Recipe B: Carousel with manual swipe</li>
              <li>Recipe C: No swipes, All the slides are stacked</li>
            </ul>
          </p>

          <p>
            Result: Increase in carousel engagements in B and C. But, All the primary metrics were inconclusive like
            Revenue. So, the recommendation was to remain with control.

        <div className='experiment-card'>
          <h5>Sponsored Listings in List pages</h5>
          <p>
            Hypothesis: The addition of auction-based paid listings in Browse PLPs will result in higher overall RPV

          <p>Target: Product list pages</p>
          <p>

        <div className='experiment-card'>
          <h5>3 SKU banner copy</h5>
          <p>
            Hypothesis: Label updated to "Promoted Products" from "Featured Products" on the 3-SKU Banner will not
            negatively impact revenue.
          </p>
          <p>Target: Product listing page</p>
          <p>
            Recipes:

            </ul>
          </p>

          <p>
            Result: The hypothesis proved true, there was no impact to revenue when changing the banner at the top of
            the list page. It was recommended that the stakeholders make the change from "Featured Products" to
            "Promoted Products" because there was no detriment in the primary metrics.

          </p>

          <p>
            Result: Sticky add to cart could be implemented as it saw an increase in add to carts of product display
