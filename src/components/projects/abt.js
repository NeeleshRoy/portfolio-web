            I was a part of a team called digital experimentation and customer experience optimization. I used a tool
            called optimizely to set up A/B and A/B/N tests throughout DOTCOM. At First, I used to set up the
            experiments, collect the metrics data and share it to the stakeholders. Later on, I dived into developing
            hypothesis for the experimentation program.
          </p>
          <p>
            We used a tool called optimizely to set up all the experiments. Optimizely is also integrated with Adobe
            analytics (Custom) to take care of all the primary metrics.
          </p>
          <p>
            My experiments and implementations has led to 27% recipe wins in Large view and 24% recipe wins in small
            view web in the FY-2019. I have delivered 80+ experiments till now.

              <h3>Last item viewed toast message</h3>
              <p>
                <b>Hypothesis</b>: By drawing the customer attention to the last item they viewed and Shopping History
                to see all their Recently Viewed items, we deliver a friction-free experience that will result in higher
                conversion.
              </p>
              <p>
                <b>Target</b>: Entire site except cart and after, in the funnel
              </p>
              <p>
                <b>Recipes</b>:
                <ul>
                  <li>Control: Does not have a toast message</li>
                  <li>Recipe B: Toast message with only text</li>
                  <li>Recipe C: Toast message with text and product images</li>

              </p>

              <p>
                <b>Result</b>: Increase in shopping history engagement and the uber menu engagement. But, none of them
                actually lifted the purchase conversion, or RPV etc. So, either of them could be implemented.

              <h3>Small view web - primary carousel presentation</h3>
              <p>
                <b>Hypothesis</b>: By enhancing the small view presentation of the primary message we can increase
                engagement and overall performance.
              </p>
              <p>
                <b>Target</b>: Web small view, homepage only

              </p>

              <p>
                <b>Result</b>: Increase in carousel engagements in B and C. But, All the primary metrics were
                inconclusive like Revenue. So, the recommendation was to remain with control.

              <p>
                <b>Hypothesis</b>: The addition of auction-based paid listings in Browse PLPs will result in higher

                <b>Hypothesis</b>: Label updated to "Promoted Products" from "Featured Products" on the 3-SKU Banner
                will not negatively impact revenue.

                <b>Result</b>: The hypothesis proved true, there was no impact to revenue when changing the banner at
                the top of the list page. It was recommended that the stakeholders make the change from "Featured
                Products" to "Promoted Products" because there was no detriment in the primary metrics.
