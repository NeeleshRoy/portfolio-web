          <h1>Introduction</h1>
          <p>
            Brochures are one of the most regular design works that I've done in my 3 years of design career. I was
            working as a contingent worker (CW) for Bestbuy DOTCOM. Bestbuy defines the Chennai TCS account as an
            extension of their digital arm. So, mid-senior management and CXO level bestbuy associates/delegates used to
            visit chennai, India as there are about 20 product teams who deliver quality code and design from Chennai.
            This event is defined as a 'client visit' by the Chennai Bestbuy development centre.
          </p>
          <p>I used to design brochures for this visit. It is usually a week design process.</p>

          <p>Here are some of the recent designs with details of the delegates:</p>
